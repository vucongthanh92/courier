# AWS Dev Environment Plan

## Status and scope

This is the technical source of truth for Courier's agreed AWS development
environment. It is based on the Notion plan, read on 2026-10-15, and on a
source review of the `main` branch of every Courier repository. It covers a
continuously running development and demo environment, not a production HA
environment.

Constraints that are already agreed:

- AWS credit: USD 200; target ongoing AWS budget: at most USD 100/month.
- Kubernetes: K3s on EC2 first. EKS is a later upgrade option, not the
  baseline.
- CI: GitHub Actions. Image registry: ECR. CD: Argo CD. Argo CD does not build
  images.
- No domain has been purchased and no AWS resource must be created during P0
  or P1.
- All deployable repositories release from `main`.
- Go dependencies are resolved from committed `go.mod` and `go.sum`; service
  repositories do not commit `vendor/` as the normal CI/CD dependency source.
- Runtime CPU/RAM/disk baseline is deferred to the initial AWS EC2 environment;
  local runtime profiling is not a P0 gate.

## Evidence classification

`Verified` means checked against the named repository's local `main` snapshot
on 2026-10-15, or executed from an isolated archive of that snapshot. It does
not mean the service has been run against a real AWS environment.

`Assumption / decision pending` is a proposed implementation detail that needs
measurement, a cost estimate, or an explicit decision before it becomes a
deployment commitment.

## Verified source inventory

| Component | Repository / branch reviewed | Build result | Runtime dependencies observed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shared contracts, migrations, Kafka, tracing, initial K8s/Argo | `courier` (`courier-common`) / `main` | Shared module not independently tested | PostgreSQL migrations, Kafka, observability stack |
| Identity / SSO | `courier-user-svc` / `main` | `go test -mod=vendor ./...` passed | PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Loki, OAuth providers |
| Chat / WebSocket | `courier-chat-svc` / `main` | `go test -mod=vendor ./...` passed | PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, user-service gRPC, Loki |
| Payments | `courier-payment-gateway` / `main` | `go test ./...` passed; `go build -mod=vendor` failed because vendor metadata is stale | PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, user-service gRPC, SePay Sandbox, Loki |
| Agent | `courier-agent-gateway` / `main` | `go test -mod=vendor ./...` passed | Kafka, Qdrant, OpenAI-compatible API |
| Conversa | `courier-conversa-app` / `main` | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm run build` passed | API/WSS endpoints supplied at frontend build time |
| Flikk | `courier-flikk-app` / `main` | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm run build` passed | API/WSS endpoints supplied at frontend build time |

The two frontend production artifacts measured from that build were 2.9 MiB
(Conversa) and 256 KiB (Flikk), including generated source maps/assets. These
are artifact-size observations, **not** a memory or capacity baseline.

Native ARM64 build artifacts measured 81 MiB (user), 65 MiB (chat), 54 MiB
(payment), and 12 MiB (agent). These are local Mach-O executable sizes and
must not be used as Linux container image sizes.

### Verified deployment readiness gaps

- Only user-service and agent-gateway have Dockerfiles in their service repos.
  Chat, payment, Conversa, and Flikk need reproducible production image
  definitions before they can be deployed by the planned pipeline.
- User and chat currently use a local `replace` for
  `github.com/vucongthanh92/courier/shared` to
  `../courier-common/shared`. Payment pins a pseudo-version instead. CI must
  build every service from a clean checkout, so all consumers need a released
  or pinned shared-module version; a `go.work` file is for local development
  only.
- Payment's checked-in `vendor/modules.txt` is inconsistent with `go.mod`:
  `go build -mod=vendor` fails. The agreed remediation is to stop tracking and
  relying on vendored dependencies in service repos, then enforce
  `go mod download`, `go mod verify`, and `go test/build -mod=readonly` in CI.
  A future air-gapped requirement would be an explicit exception: commit a
  complete, regenerated vendor tree and use it consistently.
- The existing monorepo workflow builds only user-service, pushes to GHCR, and
  also tags `latest`. It is not the ECR + SHA/digest + GitOps PR workflow
  agreed for AWS dev.
- The current Kustomize/Argo material deploys only user-service. It uses
  `latest`, TCP probes, and has no resource requests or limits.
- Kafka's current compose definition has no persistent Kafka data volume and
  advertises `localhost` externally. It cannot be used unchanged by K3s pods.
- User, chat, and payment local configs expose HTTP/gRPC/health/metrics ports
  and use PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, and Loki. Agent adds Qdrant and an AI
  provider. These are the minimum data and secret inventories for P0.
- User and chat configuration declares database pools up to 200 open
  connections per read and write pool; payment declares the same. These are
  configured ceilings, not observed usage, and must be reduced or justified
  against the selected PostgreSQL connection budget.
- User and chat startup use machine ID `1`; payment uses `3`. Replica-safe ID
  allocation must be resolved before horizontal scaling.

## Target architecture

| Layer | Initial plan | Boundary / rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application cluster | One EC2 K3s server running Argo CD, ingress, API deployments, and frontend static-web deployments | Deliberately non-HA for dev; must recover after reboot |
| Stateful data | Separate EC2 data node for PostgreSQL, Redis, one Kafka broker, and Qdrant with persistent gp3 volumes | Keeps state off application pods; each single-node service remains a known SPOF |
| Database decision | PostgreSQL on the data node with external S3 backup and restore verification | Replaces the prior RDS option to fit the USD 50/month target |
| Ingress | Traefik with cert-manager/one coordinated ACME writer | HTTPS after domain/DNS are approved; internal admin UIs remain private |
| Delivery | GitHub Actions builds ECR images using OIDC, then opens a GitOps image-update PR; Argo CD syncs merged Git | Immutable SHA/digest tags; no `latest` deployments |
| Configuration / secrets | Non-secret config in Kustomize ConfigMaps; secrets from an approved secret mechanism | Never commit credentials; frontend values are build-time values |
| Observability | Prometheus + Grafana first, then logs/traces with bounded retention | Requests/limits and measurements determine the storage budget |
| Backup | EBS/S3 and database backup, with restore drills | A volume is not a backup |

### P2 sizing and cost decisions (2026-10-16)

The following decisions are agreed for the initial development environment.
They are a cost-constrained baseline, not a capacity guarantee; runtime
measurements on EC2 remain required before scaling.

| Component | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Region | `ap-southeast-2` (Sydney); selected because the Organization SCP already permits it |
| Operating schedule | Start the two EC2 instances for development work and stop them afterward; planning baseline is 120 instance-hours/month each (4 hours/day × 30 days) |
| Application EC2 | `t4g.large` (2 vCPU, 8 GiB): K3s, Traefik, Argo CD, four backend services, two static frontends, and a compact Prometheus/Grafana setup |
| Data EC2 | `t4g.medium` (2 vCPU, 4 GiB): PostgreSQL, Redis, one Kafka broker, and Qdrant |
| EBS | gp3: 25 GiB application root, 25 GiB data root, and 60 GiB data volume (110 GiB total) |
| Object storage | Two S3 buckets: one for files and one for backups |
| Public boundary | HTTPS only; databases, data services, Argo CD, and Grafana remain private |
| Cost guardrails | AWS Budget alerts at USD 25, 40, and 47; disk-usage alerts at 70% and 85%; short log retention and backup lifecycle transitions |

The current compute estimate is USD 10.18/month for the application node and
USD 5.09/month for the data node. At the selected 110 GiB gp3 baseline, EBS is
estimated at USD 10.56/month. These estimates assume no NAT Gateway and do not
make stopped EBS volumes, public IPv4 addresses, S3 objects, or logs free.
The working all-in target is approximately USD 47/month with a hard operating
budget of USD 50/month. Network egress, logs, and backup growth must be watched
because the remaining buffer is small.

## Network, DNS, and security plan

- When a domain is selected, use dedicated development subdomains for Conversa,
  Flikk, auth, chat API, and payment API. Confirm registration *and renewal*
  price before buying; a registrar DNS service is acceptable.
- Public access is limited to the HTTPS frontends, required APIs, and validated
  webhooks. PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Qdrant, Argo CD, Grafana, and pprof stay
  private or are accessed through a controlled tunnel/VPN.
- Before OAuth/SSO/webhook acceptance: configure exact CORS origins, trusted
  proxy settings, callback allowlists, PKCE/state validation, Secure/HttpOnly/
  SameSite cookies, and no token-bearing WebSocket query values in access logs.
- Use separate least-privilege IAM roles for GitHub OIDC image publishing and
  Argo CD repository read access. Terraform owns AWS; Argo CD owns Kubernetes
  resources.

## Delivery, migration, and rollback rules

1. A pull request runs repository-local lint/test/build checks.
2. A merge to `main` builds the exact commit, pushes an immutable ECR tag or
   digest using GitHub OIDC, and opens a GitOps update PR.
3. After the GitOps PR is merged, Argo CD reconciles the Kustomize overlay.
4. Migrations run once, serially, from the matching `shared/migrations`
   revision, under a lock. Application startup must not race on shared
   migrations.
5. Use expand/contract migrations. An image rollback does not automatically
   roll back schema or data.
6. A rollout requires readiness, bounded startup/liveness behavior, smoke
   tests, and a Git revert path to the prior image.

## P0 — inventory, clean builds, and measurement

### Completed in this iteration

- Read all existing repository instructions: only this repository currently
  contains an `AGENTS.md` in the reviewed Courier workspace.
- Reviewed the specified seven repository `main` branches without treating
  dirty local worktrees or feature branches as `main` evidence.
- Recorded build and dependency evidence above from isolated `git archive`
  snapshots.
- Identified configuration surfaces and secret categories: database DSNs,
  Redis, Kafka, OAuth, SMTP/Slack/Loki, SePay, Qdrant, and AI-provider keys.
- Confirmed local Docker daemon access is unavailable in the present execution
  environment. Local image builds and runtime profiling were not run; runtime
  profiling is intentionally deferred to EC2.

### Still required before selecting AWS sizes

| Measurement | Method | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Idle CPU/RAM per service and shared platform | Sample process/container RSS, CPU, and goroutines after warm-up on the initial EC2 environment | Deferred to EC2 by decision |
| Load CPU/RAM, latency, error rate | Run incremental authenticated API/WSS/chat/payment scenarios on EC2; record p50/p95/p99, CPU, RSS, DB connections, Redis memory, Kafka lag, and Qdrant memory | Deferred to EC2 by decision |
| Disk growth | Record PostgreSQL/Kafka/Qdrant volume growth, image sizes, Prometheus/Loki/tracing retention, and backup sizes on EC2 | Deferred to EC2 by decision |
| Connection budgets | Capture observed PostgreSQL and Redis connections on EC2 while all services are live; set pools/requests/limits accordingly | Deferred to EC2 by decision |
| Image build/runtime | Build each production image for the chosen architecture, scan its size, run as non-root where appropriate, and execute health probes | Blocked locally by Docker daemon access and missing Dockerfiles |
| AWS estimate | Enter final measured sizes and final region into AWS Pricing Calculator; compare gross usage to the USD 100/month target | Not started; no AWS resource created |

P0 does **not** approve provisioning. It produces the evidence needed for the
P1 fixes and then a costed P2 decision.

### P1 configuration order (agreed)

Proceed before EC2 sizing with non-secret development configuration for the
four backend services: user-service, chat-service, payment-gateway, and
agent-gateway. The work must make service-to-service names, ports, external
endpoints, ConfigMap values, and required secret keys explicit without placing
secret values in Git. Runtime requests/limits remain provisional until the EC2
measurements are collected.

#### Backend configuration contract

| Service | Verified application ports | In-cluster dependency names | Secret inputs that must stay out of Git | P1 implementation note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| user-service | HTTP `5001`, gRPC `6001`, health `7001`, metrics `8001` | PostgreSQL, `redis:6379`, `kafka:9092` | PostgreSQL DSN, Redis password, OAuth client credentials, SMTP/Slack credentials | Render or mount a full dev config file; the existing Kubernetes deployment declares `5000`/`5001`, which conflicts with its checked-in dev configuration. |
| chat-service | HTTP `5002`, gRPC `6002`, health `7002`, metrics `8002` | PostgreSQL, `redis:6379`, `kafka:9092`, `user-service:6001` | PostgreSQL DSN, Redis password | Add its image and manifest, then mount a full dev config file. Kafka producer code that hard-codes `localhost:9092` must be switched to configuration. |
| payment-gateway | HTTP `5003`, gRPC `6003`, health `5103` | PostgreSQL, `redis:6379`, `kafka:9092`, `user-service:6001` | PostgreSQL DSN, Redis password, SePay merchant/secret/webhook values | Its loader expands configured environment-variable placeholders; create an image and mount config plus a secret reference. |
| agent-gateway | HTTP `5010` | `qdrant:6333`, `kafka:9092` | Qdrant API key, AI-provider API key | Its loader has explicit environment overrides; create config/secret references and retain concurrency/timeouts as provisional values. |

Do not rely on a bare `envFrom` ConfigMap to override user/chat nested YAML
settings: their current Viper-based loading unmarshals the file configuration
and does not bind each environment key. P1 must either mount a rendered config
file plus an approved secret source, or change and test the loaders to bind the
documented environment variables. This is a verified implementation constraint,
not an assumption.

## Sequenced implementation plan

### P1 — source and build readiness

#### Current implementation status (2026-10-15)

- **Verified — user-service clean-build baseline:** its isolated P1 branch pins
  `github.com/vucongthanh92/courier/shared` to
  `v0.0.0-20261011113145-43c7030c3c51`, removes the local `replace`, ignores
  `vendor/`, and removes the tracked vendor tree. `go mod verify` and
  `go test -mod=readonly ./...` pass without a sibling checkout.
- **Verified — health/config contract:** the dev deployment now exposes HTTP
  `5001`, gRPC `6001`, health `7001`, and metrics `8001`; mounts the complete
  `config.yaml` from the manually provisioned `user-service-config` Secret;
  and uses `/live` for startup/liveness and `/ready` for readiness. Readiness
  now includes asynchronous read/write database pings.
- **Verified — deployment tag policy:** the base manifest no longer declares
  `latest`; the dev overlay supplies the temporary `dev` tag. CI-to-ECR/Argo
  CD must replace it with an immutable commit-SHA digest before a real deploy.
- **Not yet verified:** no Docker image was built locally because the Docker
  daemon is unavailable; no Kubernetes cluster, AWS resource, domain, or
  secret value has been created.
- **Verified — chat-service clean-build baseline:** its isolated P1 branch
  likewise removes the local shared-module `replace` and tracked `vendor/`,
  adds CI and a multi-stage Dockerfile, routes Kafka fallback to `kafka:9092`,
  and starts `/live` plus database-backed `/ready` health endpoints. `go mod
  verify`, `go test -mod=readonly ./...`, and `go build -mod=readonly ./...`
  pass. Its dev Kustomize overlay follows the same complete-config Secret
  mount model as user-service.

#### P1 source-readiness closure record (2026-10-15)

The source/build portion of P1 is complete for the six deployable application
repositories. The following is verified from GitHub, rather than inferred from
local worktrees: each P1 pull request was merged, and the most recent `CI`
workflow triggered by the resulting push to `main` completed successfully.

| Repository | Merged P1 pull request | Verified CI result on `main` | P1 result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `courier-user-svc` | [#4](https://github.com/vucongthanh92/courier-user-svc/pull/4) | [successful run](https://github.com/vucongthanh92/courier-user-svc/actions/runs/38705667421) | Clean Go dependency resolution, image build definition, CI, and health/config contract |
| `courier-chat-svc` | [#4](https://github.com/vucongthanh92/courier-chat-svc/pull/4) | [successful run](https://github.com/vucongthanh92/courier-chat-svc/actions/runs/38710826544) | Clean Go dependency resolution, image build definition, CI, and health/config contract |
| `courier-payment-gateway` | [#1](https://github.com/vucongthanh92/courier-payment-gateway/pull/1) | [successful run](https://github.com/vucongthanh92/courier-payment-gateway/actions/runs/38709108284) | Clean Go dependency resolution, image build definition, CI, and health/config contract |
| `courier-agent-gateway` | [#1](https://github.com/vucongthanh92/courier-agent-gateway/pull/1) | [successful run](https://github.com/vucongthanh92/courier-agent-gateway/actions/runs/38711265380) | Clean Go dependency resolution, image build definition, and CI |
| `courier-conversa-app` | [#1](https://github.com/vucongthanh92/courier-conversa-app/pull/1) | [successful run](https://github.com/vucongthanh92/courier-conversa-app/actions/runs/38747384166) | Reproducible pnpm build, container build, and CI; workspace settings permit `esbuild` in both CI and Docker builds |
| `courier-flikk-app` | [#1](https://github.com/vucongthanh92/courier-flikk-app/pull/1) | [successful run](https://github.com/vucongthanh92/courier-flikk-app/actions/runs/38747829784) | Reproducible pnpm build, container build, and CI; workspace settings permit `esbuild` in both CI and Docker builds |

The initial failed frontend CI attempts are superseded by the successful runs
above. Their root causes and permanent fixes were: valid block-form YAML for
the Docker tag, `pnpm/action-setup` before `setup-node` cache initialization,
a root package declaration in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and copying that workspace
file before Docker's dependency-install layer.

This closure record does **not** claim that the applications run on Kubernetes
or AWS. No ECR registry, AWS resource, domain, production secret, Kubernetes
cluster, or live image deployment has been created. The existing Kustomize
config-file Secret mount has been prepared for user, chat, and payment only;
agent and frontend deployment manifests, image publishing, GitOps promotion,
runtime sizing, and AWS cost approval are subsequent work.

1. Pin the shared Go module for clean CI builds; retain `go.work` only as an
   optional developer convenience.
2. Add production Dockerfiles for chat, payment, Conversa, and Flikk; update
   existing Dockerfiles for pinned bases, compatible target architecture, and
   non-root execution where practical.
3. Move all deploy-time endpoints/secrets to the approved configuration model;
   make frontend public values explicit at build time.
4. Make machine ID assignment replica-safe and ensure graceful shutdown/
   connection draining.
5. Add app manifests with HTTP health semantics, startup/readiness/liveness
   probes, requests/limits, and immutable images.

### P2–P7 — infrastructure and acceptance

- **P2:** Terraform for IAM/MFA, VPC/security groups, EC2/EBS/ECR/S3, billing
  alerts, and the chosen database; only after a regional estimate is approved.
- **P3:** K3s, PostgreSQL/migration ownership, persistent Redis/Kafka/Qdrant,
  ingress, TLS, backup/restore drill.
- **P4:** user-service plus both frontends; prove cross-app SSO under the real
  HTTPS domain.
- **P5:** chat Redis fanout/WSS reconnect and SePay sandbox idempotency tests.
- **P6:** agent Kafka/Qdrant/AI controls plus metrics/logs/traces.
- **P7:** GitOps for every app, rollback, controlled node reboot/restore, and
  scaling exercises.

## Acceptance gates

No phase may claim production-grade HA. The required AWS-dev gates are:

- Cross-frontend SSO works through HTTPS with direct-entry callback, expiry,
  logout, and invalid-state coverage.
- Chat survives a rolling deployment with reconnect/backoff, missed-message
  recovery, deduplication, and Redis fanout across replicas.
- Payment webhook delivery is signature/timestamp checked and idempotent under
  duplicate/concurrent events and transaction failures.
- Deployments do not route to unready pods; rollback, pod loss, controlled
  reboot, and a backup restore have documented, tested runbooks.

## Explicit non-actions

This work did not create AWS resources, purchase a domain, select a billed AWS
service, or write credentials into the repository.
